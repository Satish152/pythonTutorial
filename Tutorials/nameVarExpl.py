# "__name__" is a special Python variable. ... In Python, you can import that script as a module
# in another script. Thanks to this special variable, you can decide whether you want to run the script.
# Or that you want to import the functions defined in the script.

import nameVarEx

print("this is name val script")

#using name variable condition in the nameVarEx class, stopping the class to execute the defined methofs in the
